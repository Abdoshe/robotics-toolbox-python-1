Port of Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox library to Python 3.


This is just a test.  So far only the following functions and their unit tests
have been ported:

rot2
rotx, roty, rotz

trot2
trotx, troty, trotz

se2, se3

r2t
t2r
rpy2r, rpy2t (was just rpy2tr in the original)
tr2rpy
rpy2jac


Licence
-------
Tentatively licensed under the GPLv3.


Requirements
------------
Python 3.5+ and numpy 1.10+ to use the library and run tests.

Sphinx with the numpydoc extension to generate documentation.


Usage
-----
You will need to add the repo's top directory to the PYTHONPATH environment
variable.  On Linux:

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/robotics-toolbox-python


You can then use the library with:

from robotools.transform import *

See tests for examples of how the functions are used.


To run the tests (all passing currently) run the following from the top
directory:

python -m unittest tests/*

Ensure that python is your 3.5+ interpreter with numpy installed.  The best way
to set this up is to use a venv.


Documentation
-------------
Documentation follows numpy conventions where reasonable.  This means Sphinx is
used to generate documentation.  So far, all the documentation is in docstrings.
Edit docs/index.rst and docs/apireference.rst to update what is shown.

To generate the documentation, ensure your PYTHONPATH environment variable
includes the repo directory as per instructions in Usage above, then in the docs
directory, run:

make html

This will build the html version of the documentation which you can then browse
by opening docs/_build/index.html.
